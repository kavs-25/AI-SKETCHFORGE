# Title : AI Sketchforge 
# Description:
           This project aims to develop an AI model for artistic image synthesis by leveraging the style and characteristics of renowned painters' works. The model utilizes deep learning techniques to learn and extract the artistic style from a collection of paintings by famous artists. Upon receiving an input image containing a human face, the model employs face detection algorithms to isolate and extract the facial features. Subsequently, it applies style transfer algorithms to map the facial features onto the extracted artistic style learned from the provided paintings. The resulting output image seamlessly integrates the facial features of the input image with the artistic style of the selected painter's works. The proposed model offers a novel approach to artistic image manipulation, allowing users to transform ordinary portraits into unique and aesthetically pleasing compositions inspired by renowned painters' styles. 
## Uses:

1) Artistic Image Synthesis: The primary use of this project is to generate artistic images by combining the facial features of a human subject with the style of renowned painters' works. Users can transform ordinary portraits into unique compositions inspired by various artistic styles.
2) Creative Expression: The project provides a platform for users to express their creativity by experimenting with different combinations of input images and artistic styles. It allows individuals to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and visual arts, creating visually appealing compositions.
3) Artistic Exploration: Artists and designers can utilize the project to explore different artistic styles and experiment with incorporating them into their work. It serves as a source of inspiration and a tool for exploring new avenues in digital art creation.

## Problem it Solves:

1) Limited Access to Artistic Styles: Traditional methods of artistic image synthesis often require manual effort and expertise to recreate the styles of renowned painters. This project solves the problem of limited access to diverse artistic styles by leveraging deep learning techniques to learn and extract style characteristics from a collection of paintings.
2) Time-Consuming Manual Editing: Without automated tools, transforming an image to adopt a specific artistic style can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. By automating the process through deep learning and style transfer algorithms, this project significantly reduces the time and effort required for artistic image manipulation
3) Lack of Creative Inspiration: Individuals may struggle to find creative inspiration or explore new artistic styles. This project addresses this problem by offering a platform for users to experiment with different combinations of input images and artistic styles, sparking creativity and encouraging artistic exploration.
 
 ## Challenges we ran into:

1) Style Extraction: Extracting and representing the artistic style from the selected paintings in a meaningful way is non-trivial. Developing techniques to capture and encode the unique elements of each artist's style accurately is challenging.

2) Facial Feature Extraction: Accurately detecting and extracting facial features from input images, especially in various lighting conditions, poses a challenge. Ensuring robustness to handle different facial orientations, expressions, and occlusions is essential.

3) Style Transfer Algorithms: Designing effective style transfer algorithms that can seamlessly blend the extracted artistic style with the facial features while preserving the identity and details of the input image is complex. Balancing style fidelity and content preservation is challenging.
